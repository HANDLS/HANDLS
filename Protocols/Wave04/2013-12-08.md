Sample Size | 3720
Accrual Ceiling | 4000
Study Population | The baseline HANDLS sample consists of 3720 community-dwelling African American and white adults aged 30-64. Participants were drawn from 13 neighborhoods (groups of contiguous census tracts) in Baltimore City, sampling representatively across a wide range of socioeconomic and income circumstances.
Accrual Period | 2004-2009
Study Design | The heuristic study design is a factorial cross of four factors: age, sex, race, and SES with approximately equal numbers of subjects per “cell” (Figure 2 on page 23). HANDLS is planned as a 20-year longitudinal study of the 3720 individuals accrued (Figure 3 on page 23). Using our mobile medical research vehicles, we are revisiting each census tract for 2-3 months over the next 3 years.
Study Duration | Start Date: 2004; End Date: 2024
Primary Objective | The primary objective of HANDLS is to conduct a longitudinal study of minority health, aging, and health disparities focused on investigating the differential influences of race and socioeconomic status on health in an urban population.

# Précis

The Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span (HANDLS) study is an interdisciplinary, community-based, prospective longitudinal epidemiologic study examining the influences of race and socioeconomic status (SES) on the development of age-related health disparities among socioeconomically diverse African Americans and whites in Baltimore. This study investigates whether health disparities develop or persist due to differences in SES, differences in race, or their interaction. Planned as a 20-year longitudinal study, HANDLS is unique because it assesses physical parameters as well as evaluating genetic, biologic, demographic, and psychosocial parameters of African American and white participants over a wide range of socioeconomic statuses. HANDLS also employs novel research tools, mobile medical research vehicles, in hopes of improving participation rates and retention among non-traditional research participants. The domains of the HANDLS study include: nutrition, cognition, biologic biomarkers, body composition and bone quality, physical function and performance, psychology, genomics, neighborhood environment and cardiovascular disease. Utilizing data from these study domains will facilitate an understanding of selected underlying factors of persistent black-white health disparities in overall longevity, cardiovascular disease, and cognitive decline.

HANDLS recruited a fixed cohort as an area probability sample of Baltimore City from August 2004 through November 2009 as Wave 1 (Figure 1). HANDLS Wave 2 entitled *The Association of Personality and Socioeconomic status with Health Status – An Interim Follow-up Study* began in June 2006 under a separate protocol. It was designed as a follow-up telephone interview approximately 18 months after the initial examination (Wave 1) was complete. Wave 2 provided interim contact with study participants, and important interim information regarding their health. Now completed, wave 3 was the first follow-up examination and participants’ second visit to our mobile Medical Research Vehicles (MRVs). The current protocol outlines Wave 4, the second follow-up examination and participants’ third visit to our mobile Medical Research Vehicles (MRVs). Planned as a follow-up after 3-4 years, Wave 4 consists of health examinations, a telephone dietary-recall interview, renal function assessments, and optional studies of circadian rhythm, structural MRIs, and an evaluation of the subjective experience of diabetes mellitus.

# Background & scientific rationale

There are well-documented differences in health status among groups defined by age, race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status (SES).
